# IMDB Movies: Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on the analysis of the 500 highest rated IMDB movies between 2000-2012. The movies have been examined in terms of different characteristics, such as gross revenue, popularity, etc. The project serves as a demonstration of web-scrapping via Beautiful Soup, as well as data exploratory analysis.

Workflow followed
The process I followed has generally been:

1.Data scrapping
2.Data cleaning, reshaping, quality checks
3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4.Final interactive visualization on Tableau Software

For the data extraction I have used the Beautiful Soup library.

For data cleaning and manipulation I have made use of numpy/pandas, and the EDA phase involved use of matplotlib / seaborn.

Eventually, the final dataset has been exported to csv file and passed as a datasource to an interactive Tableau Dashboard, which provides different insights.
